collect-sched-delays.rb runs measure-sched-delays on each cpu sending
output to a bunch of per-cpu files.

Each line of output is unix epoch real time and lateness of timer
signal in nanoseconds.

measure-sched-delays needs root as it runs under real-time priority.

The goal is to measure virtualization environment delays.
